## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two different areas: my research and my professional life. First of all, for my professional life, I am working on creating tools for English teachers to use in their classes to improve student motivation and ease of learning. For my research, I am working on sarcasm detection as a branch of sentiment analysis, using NLP models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how the hell to use GitHub as well as how to create my first website and improve accuracy of NLP models.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on teacher tools! Any ideas from people who want to work together, please drop me a line.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the front-end side of my janky website.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want.
